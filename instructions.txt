CZN Pathfinder - find the best way to navigate chaos maps. 

Once the full map is provided, you can define priority for different nodes (normal fights, elite, rest, etc), and script will show you the best possible path.
Use the panel on the right side of the window, it updates map in real time.

Now, how to get a full map? The game does not provide it at the moment (lets hope it changes in the future), so you have three options.

Option 1: run automatic scan. This will move the mouse programmatically and do all work for you.
This is not a bot / cheat, it simply drags the map until it sees the boss. It will not play through the map instead of you.
Requirements:
	The game is opened in windowed mode, at the start of a chaos run, the minimap is shown and in default position (not moved left/right).
	The script is running with admin privileges (game is also admin, so it will ignore signals sent by a non-admin process).
	It takes about 1-2s for a screenshot, and 5-10 screenshots for the full map. You MUST observe it working, at least first few times, as it may break in some way.
	If you see it misbehaving, quickly move mouse to the top left corner to stop it.
	Selecting folder is optional, it will output saved screenshots there. Without folder, scan is saved to Last_scan_result folder, previous content is deleted.
If all requirements are met, press 'Start Automatic Scanner', and a while later you should see completed map scan.
With map fragments, you can run detect_nodes.py / detect_connections.py and see how single step progresses (not required).
Tested on windows, may not work with other systems. 99% of tests were done in 1920x1080, but 1600x900 seems to work fine.

Option 2: take screenshots by yourself. This may be annoying, you will be emulating what the script is doing.
Professionally designed visual aid guide should be located somewhere in the project folder, you may want to check it.
You can also see the pathfinder working by selecting Example_scan_result folder.
Instructions:
	Make empty folder.
	Open the game, show chaos minimap in the default position.
	Take screenshot, save it as png. (For example win+shift+s, or any other tool)
	Locate rightmost node, drag it into leftmost node position, so previous and current screenshots share one column of nodes.
	Repeat until boss is visible.
	Once you screenshotted whole map, select this folder in script and choose Offline Scanner.
As script is only processing saved screenshots, this option does not require admin mode.


Option 3: run halfauto scan. This option combines two previous ones, you control the mouse and script takes screenshots.
It requires admin mode, without it script stops detecting any mouse movement once game is in focus.
Instructions:
    Open the game, show chaos minimap in the default position.
    Start halfauto scanner, switch to game window.
    Now, each mouse drag (press left mouse button, move, release button) of sufficient length will produce a screenshot.
    Locate rightmost node, drag it into leftmost node position, so previous and current screenshots share one column of nodes.
    Take care to release mouse when the map is still, do not swing map as it will destroy screenshot sequence.
    First screenshot is problematic, as there is no drag required to show right map fragment, so simply drag map vertically, from top to bottom, not moving left/right.
    Do those map movements until boss is visible, then switch to script.
    Wait for it to finish, it should not take long as it started when first screenshot was made.


Main flow of the script is more or less done, but there is no error handling.
If any subprocess breaks (like detect_nodes flagging Hugo face as Waypoint with 98% certainty), it may or may not tell you that it broke, you must notice and restart it by yourself.
After 3 weeks of development I think I fixed all the bugs Ive experienced, if you see anything new, consider making bug report. Attach Last_scan_result and log_file.log, so I can try replicating it.
