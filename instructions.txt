CZN Pathfinder - find the best way to navigate chaos maps. 

Once the full map is provided, you can define priority for different nodes (normal fights, elite, rest, etc), and script will show you the best possible path.
Use the panel on the right side of the window, it updates map in real time.

Now, how to get a full map? The game does not provide it at the moment (lets hope it changes in the future), so you have two options.

Option 1: run automatic scan. This will move the mouse programmatically and do all work for you.
This is not a bot / cheat, it simply drags the map until it sees the boss. It will not play through the map instead of you.
Requirements:
	The game is opened in windowed mode, at the start of a chaos run, the minimap is shown and in default position (not moved left/right).
	The script is running with admin privileges (game is also admin, so it will ignore signals sent by a non-admin process).
	It takes about 1-2s for a screenshot, and 5-7 screenshots for the full map. You MUST observe it working, at least first few times. This is alpha, it may break.
	If you see it misbehaving, quickly move mouse to the top left corner to stop it.
	Tested on windows, may not work with other systems.
	Full source code is available on github if you want to inspect what it does.
Selecting folder is optional, with folder it will output saved screenshots there. Use it if you want to know what the script sees.
With map fragments, you can run detect_nodes.py / detect_connections.py and see how single step progresses.
	
Option 2: take screenshots by yourself. This may be annoying, you will be emulating what the script is doing.
Professionally designed visual aid guide should be located somewhere in the project folder, you may want to check it.
Instructions:
	Make empty folder.
	Open the game, show the map in the default position.
	Take screenshot, save it as png.
	Locate rightmost node, drag it into leftmost node position, so previous and current screenshots share one column of nodes.
	Repeat until boss is visible.
	Once you screenshotted whole map, select this folder in script and choose Offline Scanner.

This is alpha version, main flow is more or less done, but there is no error handling. May be implemented in the future.
It was tested on ~50 maps, and I'm still seeing new errors, running another 500 would not make me sure that I caught everything.
If any subprocess breaks (like detect_nodes flagging Hugo face as Waypoint with 98% certainty), it may or may not tell you
that it broke, you must notice and restart it by yourself.
